### Playing with ruby actors

an example of GenServer implementation from [elixir forum thread](https://elixirforum.com/t/ruby-3-0-actor-model-and-genserver-implementation/37230)

Run with ruby >= 3.0.0:

  ```bash
  ruby stack.rb
  ```

TODO:
  - rewrite in a more ruby-idiomatic way
  - test performace, make some comparisons
  - test for data safety (immutability)
